      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6">Technical Superiority</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        JPEG XL stands out as a modern image format that offers lossless JPEG
        recompression, saving ~20% space without any quality loss from your
        existing JPEG files.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">Compared to WebP and AVIF, JPEG XL excels with:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-6">
        <li>Better compression at the same quality level</li>
        <li>Faster encode/decode speeds</li>
        <li>Support for progressive rendering</li>
        <li>Wide color gamut and HDR support</li>
        <li>Lossless preservation of original JPEG files</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6">The Politics Behind Its Demise</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Despite its technical merits, JPEG XL faced an unexpected setback in
        late 2022 when Google announced its removal from Chromium, effectively
        killing its momentum in major browsers.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The decision sparked controversy in the web development community, as it
        appeared to favor Google's own AVIF format. Google cited "low usage" as
        the reason, creating a chicken-and-egg problem: how could adoption grow
        without browser support?
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Mozilla and other browser vendors followed suit, leaving JPEG XL in
        limbo despite its strong technical advantages and the backing of the
        JPEG committee itself.

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6">Community Response</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The open-source community rallied behind JPEG XL, with developers and content creators
        advocating for its adoption. Several high-profile projects continued supporting the format
        through polyfills and alternative implementations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Photographers and digital artists were particularly vocal, emphasizing JPEG XL's superior
        handling of high-quality images and its ability to preserve their work without generation loss.

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6">Current State and Usage</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        While major browser support remains limited, JPEG XL continues to find adoption in specialized
        fields like professional photography, digital archiving, and scientific imaging.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The format is supported by popular image editing software like GIMP and ImageMagick, and
        several content delivery networks (CDNs) have begun offering JPEG XL conversion services.

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6">Future Prospects</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Despite the setbacks in browser adoption, JPEG XL's technical advantages make it a compelling
        choice for the future of image compression. The format continues to evolve, with ongoing
        development and optimization by its dedicated community.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        As storage and bandwidth demands grow with increasing image resolutions and quality
        expectations, the need for more efficient compression formats becomes more pressing,
        potentially leading to a future reassessment of JPEG XL's role in web standards.
