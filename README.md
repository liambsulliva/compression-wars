# Compression Wars: JPEG XL

Welcome to **Compression Wars**, a project dedicated to exploring and advocating for the adoption of JPEG XL, the forgotten king of image compression formats. This project is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and leverages a neubrutalist design aesthetic to deliver a unique and engaging user experience.

## Project Overview

JPEG XL is a next-generation image format that offers superior compression and quality compared to traditional formats like JPEG and PNG. Despite its advantages, JPEG XL has not yet seen widespread adoption. This project aims to highlight its benefits and encourage its use in modern web applications.

## Design Philosophy

The project employs a neubrutalist design, characterized by bold colors, stark contrasts, and a raw, unpolished aesthetic. This design choice reflects the project's mission to challenge the status quo and promote a new standard in image compression.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator that allows for the seamless integration of various front-end frameworks.
- **Deno**: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, used for server-side rendering and deployment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.
