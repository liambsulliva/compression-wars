# Compression Wars

An academic exploration of JPEG XL and the politics of image compression, presented as a neubrutalist blog. Created for ENGFLM 0570 - Introduction to New Media, taught by Dr. Nathan Koob.

## Overview

This project examines JPEG XL through both technical and sociopolitical lenses, investigating why this next-generation image format—despite its superior compression and quality—faces adoption challenges in the modern web ecosystem. The analysis is presented through a neubrutalist design that emphasizes content clarity and visual hierarchy.

## Key Topics

- Technical deep-dive into JPEG XL's compression capabilities
- Comparative analysis with contemporary formats (HEIC, WebP, AVIF)
- Browser politics and market dynamics affecting adoption
- Interactive compression demonstrations
- Historical context of image compression standards
- Progressive loading implementations

## Design Philosophy

The project embraces neubrutalist web design principles:

- High-contrast typography using `Clash Display` and `Montserrat`
- Minimalist layout with strong visual hierarchy
- Raw, functional aesthetic
- Focus on content readability
- Mobile-responsive design

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Image Processing**: vite-imagetools (to preserve .JXL)
